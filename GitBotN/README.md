## Usage

At its core, GitBotN leverages the versatility and flexibility of a monorepo structure, allowing for efficient code organization and management. This monorepo approach enables developers to have a unified codebase for both the frontend and backend components of the application, streamlining development processes and ensuring consistency.

With its powerful tech stack, GitBotN incorporates cutting-edge technologies to deliver exceptional functionality. The backend, powered by Node.js, provides a robust runtime environment, while Express.js serves as the web application framework, facilitating efficient routing and request handling. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, offers scalable and flexible data storage, enabling GitBotN to handle large amounts of data seamlessly. GitBotN also integrates with the GitHub API, providing seamless interactions with repositories, pull requests, and issue tracking.

On the frontend, GitBotN utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an intuitive user interface. React.js, a powerful JavaScript library, enables the creation of dynamic and interactive UI components, while Redux manages the application's state. Additional frontend technologies such as Bootstrap, Webpack, and Babel enhance the user experience, optimize performance, and ensure compatibility across various devices and browsers.

When it comes to deployment, GitBotN is perfectly suited for the Vercel platform. By configuring Vercel with the appropriate deployment settings and leveraging its seamless Git integration, GitBotN can be effortlessly deployed. With Vercel, developers can ensure that the application is automatically built and deployed whenever changes are pushed to the repository, enabling a streamlined and efficient deployment process.
